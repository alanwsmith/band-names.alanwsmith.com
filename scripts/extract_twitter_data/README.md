This is where you assembled the 
names from the twitter archive

The scripts pull album and band names
which were combined and then had
some manual names added in

That's to say, don't try to run these
directly without looking at them because
you'll lose some of the ones that were 
done manually and are only in the 
`site/index.html` file.
